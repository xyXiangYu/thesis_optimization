Since the approaches we are going to use in this paper will be demonstrated with the case of rocket car. We decide to describe the rocket car first. So that, when we discuss our approaches, we can directly describe how they can be used in solving the rocket car case. The description of the rocket car case is mostly coming from the paper \cite{MatSch22}, with content either  verbatim or in a modified form. 

We consider the rocket car case with state constraints- the one-dimensional movement of a mass point under the influence of some constant declaration, e.g. modeling head-wind or sliding friction, which can accelerate and decelerate in order to reach a desired position. The mass of the car is normalized to 1 and the constant deceleration enters the model in form of an unknown parameter $p \in \omega_P \in \mathbb{R}$ suffering from uncertainty,
